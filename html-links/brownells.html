      <p>
        Zack and I decided to soak up the sun this weekend by taking a drive. We
        ended up around the Newport area and we were starting to get pretty
        hungry when we stumbled upon Brownells.
      </p>

      <p>What we munched on</p>
      <ul>
        <li>The Strippers</li>
        <li>Burrata Caprese</li>
        <li>Firecracker Shrimp</li>
        <li>The Original Gangster Burger</li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        We started out sharing the strippers which consist of breaded chicken
        tenders tossed in their secret sauce, which was kind of like a sweet and
        tangy barbecue sauce. They are served with a side of their house made
        spicy ranch and truly create the perfect combination. Zack said they
        were the best chicken strips he has ever had and I’d have to agree!
      </p>

      <p>
        I ordered the burrata caprese as I was craving something fresh and
        light. The heirloom tomatoes were not only gorgeous but they had so much
        flavor. The burrata was light and creamy and made for a perfect summer
        salad. I only wish it had more burrata, because who doesn’t love
        cheese!?
      </p>

      <p>
        I was still feeling snacky after that and everything was tasting so good
        so I ordered their firecracker shrimp. They season them with their house
        blend of hot spices and the flavor is spot on! They pack just enough
        heat without going overboard. It’s served with their “cool dip” which I
        could’ve eaten by the spoonful. It was like a creamy cilantro lime dip.
      </p>

      <p>
        Zack decided on the O.G. Burger (mostly due to the name) but it did not
        disappoint. They bake their own challah buns and load it up with two
        smash patties layered with cheese, huge slices of tomato and pickle then
        smothered in spicy aioli. Zack of course added bacon and that thing came
        out massive. He could barely take a bite of it but when he did he was
        amazed by how juicy and flavorful everything was. I kept trying to steal
        bites and he was not having it, as usual!
      </p>

      <p>
        They also have a great selection of wine and beer including some local
        brews, and do a lot of fun mimosas. Zack and I were both in the mood for
        a beer, I went with the Laughing Dog Huckleberry Cream Ale out of
        Ponderay ID. It was the best beer I’ve had in a long time, the flavor
        was somewhere in between a beer and a cider, very refreshing!
      </p>

      <p>
        If you’re in the area, you have to stop and check this place out. The
        owner and her employees are very sweet and the food comes out so fast!
        They make as much as they can in house and it shows in every dish. We
        went on a Saturday and there was even live music. You won’t be
        disappointed!
