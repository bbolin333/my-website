        If you keep up with our social media then you already know that we LOVE
        Cascadia Public House. Their upscale take on pub food combined with
        consistent quality, good service, and affordable prices make it the
        perfect spot for any occasion.
      </p>

      <p>What we enjoyed</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Garlic Fries</li>
        <li>Tofu Banh Mi</li>
        <li>Cascadia Burger</li>
        <li>Trail Blazer Burger</li>
      </ul>

        After a full day of errands without breakfast or lunch we were STARVING.
        By the time we sat down we were ready to eat the table itself, right
        away we had to get an order of their garlic fries.The fries came out
        golden brown and pippin’ hot, they’re tossed with fresh minced garlic
        and parsley, then topped with a delicious zesty garlic aioli. We
        devoured the whole bowl in what felt like 5 seconds.
      </p>

      <p>
        I got the tofu banh mi with a gorgeous side salad. The bun was perfectly
        toasted with a slight crunch and slathered with a banh mi slaw. The tofu
        was sliced thin so it crisped up on the outside and was coated in an
        asian marinade. There were large slices of cucumber to add a fresh
        crunch as well as jalapenos and cilantro. Not only is it vegan but you
        can even get it with gluten free bread! One of the many cool things
        about Cascadia is that they always provide dietary friendly options
        whether you're vegan, vegetarian, or gluten free. I opted for a side
        salad with my meal and typically restaurants just put some lettuce,
        cheese, and croutons on a plate but not Cascadia. My side salad was
        loaded with juicy cherry tomatoes, crisp red onion, shredded carrots,
        parmesan cheese, and croutons!

        Zack ordered the Trail Blazer Burger with fries. They used a northwest
        raised patty and layered it with butter lettuce, bacon, jalapenos,
        pepper jack cheese, tomatoes AND crispy onions. They used a local bun
        from Alpine bakery and smothered it in sriracha aioli. It was hard to
        get a full bite in with how packed it was but Zack scarfed it down!
      </p>

      <p>
        Zack’s dad joined us and got the Cascadia Burger. For all their burgers
        they use northwest raised patties and buns from Alpine Bakery however
        his burger was brimming with bacon, cheddar cheese, butter lettuce,
        tomato, red onion, garlic aioli, AND a fried egg. The egg was cooked
        over easy so after the first bite a little bit of yolk ran down all
        sides of the burger adding a creamy touch.

        Cascadia not only offers food that will fit anyone's diet but they have
        excellent happy hour options and on Sunday’s they offer happy hour ALL
        DAY! While we didn’t get any fun drinks this time around, one of my
        favorite drinks to get is their house margarita which will only run you
        $5 during happy hour. No matter what you are in the mood to drink you
        can be sure you’ll find something you like, they even offer a quality
        selection of wines.
      </p>

      <p>
        As we always like to note it’s best to support our locally owned
        businesses. When you dine at Cascadia you’re not only supporting one
        business, you’re supporting multiple because their ingredients are
        sourced from a variety of local vendors and farmers. Next time you’re
        around North Spokane be sure to stop in and check them out, we know you
        won’t be dissapointed!
