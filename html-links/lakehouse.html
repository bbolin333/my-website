        STOP WHAT YOU ARE DOING RIGHT NOW AND GO TO THE LAKEHOUSE BAR AND GRILL
        IN LOON LAKE. The food, staff, service, and ambience was impeccable, we
        could not believe that this restaurant is in Loon Lake. Their goal was
        to bring Spokane style dining into our backyards and they have gone
        above and beyond.

        I had the caesar salad and Zack had the house salad. EVERYTHING is made
        from scratch (they even roast their own pig when they serve pork!). The
        ranch dressing on Zack’s salad was the best ranch either of us have had.
        The fresh dill added the perfect amount of citrus and zest without being
        too overpowering. The caesar salad was perfection. I love a good caesar
        dressing and they are far and few between. Jonathan (the chef) did an
        amazing job of balancing the flavors of the garlic, lemon, and anchovy.
        We even got to try the soup which was a thai curry with yams, purple
        carrots, mushrooms, and caramelized onions.

        The pesto pasta had a luscious creamy, nutty and basil flavor. Jonathan
        uses a basil pecan pesto with white wine olive oil for the sauce and the
        vegetables are all sourced from local farms. He used zucchini, carrots,
        and grape tomatoes. The tomatoes added the perfect pop of acidity.

        Zack doesn’t typically like meatloaf but this was his favorite dish of
        the night. The meatloaf was served atop of creamy mash potatoes with a
        mouthwatering demi glaze and to top it all off was a french herb sauce
        which had capers and parsley. Each layer was put together perfectly. The
        demi glaze sauce was immensely savory but it wasn’t too thick or rich,
        the potatoes were so soft and creamy, the meatloaf itself was a
        beautiful combination of flavors, and the french herb sauce added that
        salty citrus pop at the end that tied it all together.

        The roast chicken was divine the chicken just melted in your mouth. It
        was stuffed with a succulent mushroom and sausage stuffing that paired
        perfectly with the fatty juicy flavors from the chicken. There was a
        crispy layer of skin around all of it. It was served with a pan seared
        polenta cake that was done flawlessly. The outside had a gorgeous golden
        crisp and when you cut through the inside was soft and fluffy.
      </p>

      <p>
        For dessert we had the chocolate mousse and bread pudding. The chocolate
        mousse itself had a mild cocoa flavor which went superbly with the house
        made decadent caramel that was layered on top of it. The dish was topped
        with whip cream and crumble. The bread pudding reminded me of french
        toast it was spiced and full of fruit, the drizzle of sweet cream on top
        finished the dish off marvelously.

        The staff are all so kind and make you feel at home. The general manager
        Ku’ulei is incredibly knowledgeable about all their dishes and has a
        beautiful passion for the restaurant. Cory our server was kind and
        attentive but also incredibly professional. You can tell everyone is
        proud to be there and they want to create an amazing yet affordable
        experience for their guests. They actually run a special from 4-5:30
        (Monday-Friday) where you can have a 3 course meal for $33. All of the
        menu items we tried were off of that menu.

        The restaurant itself is so spacious there is a downstairs bar area with
        pool tables and TVs if you are looking to have a fun casual night out
        and upstairs is a wonderful romantic setting if you are out to have a
        date-night. During the summer months they have a dog friendly outdoor
        patio and they even plan on having live music on Fridays starting next
        year.
      </p>
      <p>
        All their ingredients are sourced from local farms so their menu changes
        seasonally. Their business is based on small businesses supporting other
        small businesses. They get their beef from Lone Crow Ranch out of Loon
        Lake they also use Gardenspot Farms, Wade Farms, and New Heritage Farms,
        just to name a few.
      </p>
      <p>
        They have take out available as well as frozen soups that you can take
        home. Jonathan sent us home with some and I can’t wait to try them out!
      </p>
      <p>
        There is truly something for everyone at this restaurant, I promise you
        they will knock your socks off so get out there and check them out!
