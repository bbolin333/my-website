TIM: 
Just about everything on your page is in black and white, 
I'm not exactly sure if that is on purpose or not. I can see that being a beneficial thing where having the photos and the descriptions of the food 
being the focus. But when looking at the three food reviews you have a lot of white space on the page that you might be able to fix with a nice 
gradient, even doing it in a subtle black and white background would probably make it pleasing to the eye.

RESPONSE:
I personally don't care for the look of a gradient or a lot of color with my style but I made a gallery page with more photos to add color.


TIM:
You have a lot of really good information on the three establishments you are reviewing for someone who wants to take the time to go through that 
information. However, for the person looking for a short rating on where they might choose to eat that night, they may not want to spend a lot of 
time looking over an entire review you could also add an additional star rating option where you have visible image of stars rating for the
person with not as much time to read the entire review.

RESPONSE:
I totally understand this so I also added the restaurant's website links to the pictures in the gallery so people can check out places 
based on photos alone. The title of the restaurant pops up when they hover over the image

TIM:
You could also give yourself a footer that has your e-mail and Facebook links in it on each one of your pages so that they're easy to see 
and accessible.

RESPONSE:
I added a footer on all pages with this information, except on the contact page it is only the tastebudz inc

CHRISTIAN:
3. i really wouldn't call this an issue, but for a lack of other complaints i would say maybe have the navbar stay at the top for all pages
( align home page), or have them in matching positions(?)

RESPONSE:
I moved the nav bar above the header on the main page
